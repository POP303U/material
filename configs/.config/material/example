# This is the material config file, it's not made to be edited by humans but
# is still very friendly to use, just don't change the keywords or introduce
# duplicates (also not in form of comments) so your rice won't blow up (BOOOOM!),
# seriously changing `wlogout~theme` to `(random garbage)` will
# make it disfunctional!!!!!
# Warning! Comments after statements will be overwritten when values are modified!
# Warning! Actual config files should not have the keywords littered around the file (even in comments, things will break!)
# Warning! Old versions are not compatible with new versions of the rice, if you want to use an old theme, you need to insert the new config options to avoid breakage!
